# AWS NodeJS Example

This is just an example app using AWS Lambda and DynamoDB.

## Installation

1. `brew install serverless` - to install the `sls` cli tool
2. `yarn` - to install the npm dependencies

## Local development

1. `sls offline` - to start up the `serverless-offline` plugin which lets you test the lambdas and handlers locally.
